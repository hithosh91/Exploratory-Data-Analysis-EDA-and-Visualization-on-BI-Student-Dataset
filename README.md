# Main Objective:
    ---> The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the data to understand patterns, relationships, and trends that may influence academic performance.

# data columns in the bi dataset
    --->   fNAME, lNAME, Age, gender, country, residence, entryEXAM, prevEducation, studyHOURS, Python, DB
# Data Cleaning:

  .Handling missing values in Python and DB scores

  .Standardizing categorical columns such as gender, country, and previous education

  .Adjusting or removing outliers for accurate analysis


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

.Visualizing numeric columns with histograms to understand distributions

. Analyzing categorical columns with countplots to see group sizes

. Checking correlations between numeric features to identify relationships

. Using boxplots to detect outliers and compare groups

. Using scatterplots to explore relationships between study hours, entry exam scores, and course performance

# Insights:

.Identifying patterns between study hours and Python/DB scores

. Observing how demographics (gender, country, education) influence performance

. Understanding data distributions and outliers to inform future predictive modeling
